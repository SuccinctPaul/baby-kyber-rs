## Kyber
Kyber is a public key encryption system

### BabyKyber
BabyKyber is a down-scaled version of the system. 
It's equivalent to “regular” Kyber, except that the security parameters are smaller, making everything much more readable. 

Also, “regular” Kyber uses compression for ciphertexts, which we will omit here as it is not relevant for the underlying crypto system.
